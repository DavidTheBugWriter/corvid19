# covid19
(soon) Some very basic R scripts to analyse/graph UK Corvid-19 data 
## Caveats:
1) Due to timing changes in UK government release of death data there are inaccuracies in dates of mortality figures. I may be able to correct these at some point and the error is probably fairly marginal.
2) More importantly: because the government doesn't want to scare the horses it isn't doing widespread infection testing; some figures are likely to be off by an unknown order of magnitude (at least 1, probably 2 & pray god not 3). I suspect the mortality figures are reliable since death has minimal subjectivity and causes are methodically assessed and well recorded.
